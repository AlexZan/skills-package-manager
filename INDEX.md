## Key Numbers at a Glance

### Why This Exists
- **Naked npm package utility:** 20% (80% waste)
- **Skills registry utility:** 95% (5% overhead)
- **Network efficiency:** 250x faster than searching npm

### How Much It Costs
- **Phase 1 MVP:** $40/month (self-funded)
- **Phase 2 Growth:** $250/month (freemium revenue if needed)
- **Phase 3 Mature:** $1,500/month (sponsorship model)
- **Compare: PyPI:** $35K+/month (we're 1000x cheaper)

### Why We're Building This
1. **Multi-framework requirement** - Skills must work with Claude, OpenAI, Google
2. **Discovery problem** - Skills lost in 3M+ npm packages
3. **Framework integration** - Standardized interface needed
4. **Helm precedent** - Kubernetes solved this exact problem
5. **Market timing** - Window open before vendors fragment
6. **Data efficiency** - 250x smaller downloads
7. **Developer experience** - Auto-integration vs 50 lines of glue code

## Key Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Distribution Strategy
- **Decision:** npm + Skills Registry (hybrid approach)
- **Why:** Leverages npm's distribution, adds skills-specific discovery layer
- **Cost:** 6-8 weeks, $40/month Phase 1
- **Docs:** [DECISION_MATRIX.md](DECISION_MATRIX.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

### ‚úÖ Hosting Provider
- **Decision:** Fly.io for Phase 1
- **Why:** Cheapest, easiest, good scaling path
- **Cost:** $25/month app + DB, $15/month miscellaneous = $40 total
- **Docs:** [HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md](HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md)

### ‚úÖ Funding Model
- **Decision:** Hybrid (free ‚Üí freemium ‚Üí sponsored)
- **Phase 1:** Self-funded ($40/month)
- **Phase 2:** Freemium if needed ($500-2K/month potential)
- **Phase 3:** Corporate sponsorship ($20K+/month)
- **Docs:** [HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md](HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md)

### ‚è≥ Package Format
- **Decision pending:** SKILL.md (Anthropic format) + skill.yaml (extensions)
- **Next:** Create format specification
- **Docs:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (draft)

### ‚è≥ API Design
- **Decision pending:** REST API (OpenAPI 3.0)
- **Next:** Create detailed API specification
- **Docs:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (overview)

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why build a skills registry instead of using npm directly?**
A: See [DECISION_MATRIX.md](DECISION_MATRIX.md) and [NAKED_NPM_PACKAGE_ANALYSIS.md](NAKED_NPM_PACKAGE_ANALYSIS.md). Naked npm packages are only 20% useful for skills. Skills need discovery, integration, and multi-framework support.

**Q: Will this be expensive to host?**
A: No. See [HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md](HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md). Phase 1 MVP is $40/month. We're 1000x cheaper than PyPI because we don't store packages.

**Q: Who pays for this?**
A: See [HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md](HOSTING_AND_COSTS.md). Phase 1: Self-funded. Phase 2: Freemium model if needed. Phase 3: Corporate sponsorship.

**Q: Why is Helm relevant?**
A: See [EXISTING_PACKAGE_MANAGERS_ANALYSIS.md](EXISTING_PACKAGE_MANAGERS_ANALYSIS.md). Helm solved an identical problem for Kubernetes. Proves domain-specific package managers are the right solution when existing tools don't fit.

**Q: What about privacy/security?**
A: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (security section). Full details in pending [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
