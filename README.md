# Skills Package Manager

A dynamic package manager system for Roundtable skills - enabling applications to search, discover, and download skills on-demand rather than bundling them statically.

## Vision

Instead of embedding all skills into an application at build time, applications can:
- **Search** for available skills
- **Discover** new skills that match their needs
- **Download** skills dynamically at runtime
- **Install** skills into a central registry

This reduces application bundle size and enables a community-driven skills ecosystem.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduced Bundle Size** - Apps only include core runtime, download skills as needed
- **Community-Driven** - Community can contribute and share skills
- **Dynamic Discovery** - Apps can discover new skills without rebuilding
- **Flexible Versioning** - Different apps can use different skill versions
- **Decoupled Development** - Skills can evolve independently from applications

## Use Cases

### Mobile App
```
User launches mobile app â†’ App detects low storage
App downloads only essential skills for immediate tasks
User later needs specialized skill â†’ App downloads on-demand
```

### Web Application
```
User selects "Data Science" mode
App discovers available data science skills
User selects specific skills to install
App downloads and integrates selected skills
```

### Enterprise System
```
Organization maintains private skill registry
Apps authenticate and download approved skills
Skills are versioned and managed centrally
```
