# Skills Package Manager - Vision Document

## Problem Statement

Currently, AI agent skills across the ecosystem are:
- **Fragmented** - Each framework has its own skill format (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- **Not Discoverable** - No central registry to find and share skills across models
- **Not Portable** - Skills lock you into a specific LLM provider
- **Hard to Maintain** - No standardized versioning or dependency management
- **Siloed** - Skills can't be reused across projects or organizations
- **No Distribution Layer** - Anthropic has skills but no way to discover/share them

## Solution

An open, vendor-agnostic skills package manager:
- **Format-Agnostic** - Works with Claude skills, OpenAI tools, Google skills, etc.
- **Discoverable** - Central registry to search, discover, and share skills
- **Portable** - Skills can be used across different LLM providers
- **Versioned** - Proper versioning, dependencies, and conflict resolution
- **Open Standard** - Community-driven, not controlled by any single vendor
- **Community-Driven** - Anyone can publish and discover skills
- **Secure** - Package signing, verification, and optional sandboxing

## Why Now?

Anthropic released Claude Skills (Apache 2.0 open source) but **no distribution mechanism**. OpenAI will inevitably release their own format. The opportunity is to create an open standard NOW that can become the lingua franca for AI agent skills across all frameworksâ€”similar to how npm became the standard for JavaScript packages.

**Our competitive advantage:**
- Build it first (before OpenAI, Google, Meta get organized)
- Make it truly vendor-agnostic (not owned by any single LLM provider)
- Lead the standard as it emerges (contribute to A2A, MCP, or create new standard)
- Roundtable is the flagship use case that proves it works

## Core Concepts

### Skill Package
```yaml
name: data-analysis-expert
version: 1.0.0
description: Expert system for data analysis and visualization
tags: [data-science, analytics, visualization]
author: roundtable-community
license: MIT
dependencies:
  - roundtable: ">=2.0.0"
registry: https://skills.roundtable.dev
```

### Registry
Centralized service that hosts skill metadata and packages:
- **Public Registry** - Community skills (like npm/PyPI)
- **Private Registries** - Enterprise/organization skills
- **Search API** - Discover skills by tags, keywords, capability

### Installation
```bash
roundtable skills install data-analysis-expert
roundtable skills install @org/internal-skill
roundtable skills search "machine learning"
```

### Runtime Integration
Applications discover and load skills:
```typescript
const skillManager = new SkillManager({
  registryUrl: 'https://skills.roundtable.dev',
  cacheDir: '.roundtable/skills'
});

const dataSkills = await skillManager.search('data-science');
const analysisExpert = await skillManager.install('data-analysis-expert@latest');
```

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Skill Package Format
- Standard skill packaging (zip/tar)
- Metadata file (YAML/JSON)
- Version management
- Dependency specification

### 2. Registry Service
- REST API for search/discovery
- Package storage and versioning
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas

### 3. Client/Manager
- CLI commands for package management
- Runtime loader and cache
- Version resolution
- Security validation

### 4. Security Layer
- Package signing
- Registry authentication
- Sandbox/isolation for untrusted skills
- Audit logging

## Phases (Proposed)

### Phase 1: MVP - Roundtable + Claude Skills
- Universal skill package format (SKILL.md + skill.yaml)
- Claude Skills compatibility (native format, no conversion needed)
- Basic registry API (search, install, list)
- CLI commands for Roundtable
- Local cache management
- Package signing and verification
- **Goal:** Roundtable can install and use Claude skills from public registry

### Phase 2: Format Adapters & Expansion
- OpenAI tools format support (.skill/openai.json)
- Google Vertex format support (.skill/google.json)
- Framework detection and auto-format selection
- Dependency resolution across frameworks
- **Goal:** One skill package works across Claude, OpenAI, and Google ecosystems

### Phase 3: Distribution & Community
- Production registry service (scalable API)
- Public skill marketplace with search/discovery
- Community publishing workflow (verified publishers)
- Semantic versioning and dependency resolution
- CDN for package delivery
- **Goal:** Community can publish and discover skills worldwide

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Standards Leadership
- Private registries for organizations
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Audit trails and compliance features
- Enterprise skill bundles
- Contribute to A2A or MCP standards
- **Goal:** Enterprise adoption + position as reference implementation for open standards

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Leadership
- Support for additional frameworks as they emerge
- Skill composition and bundling
- Marketplace with ratings and recommendations
- Advanced discovery (ML-based recommendations)

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** Number of published community skills
- **Reuse:** Skills used across multiple applications
- **Performance:** Time to discover and install skills
- **Community:** Active contributors and maintainers
- **Security:** Zero security incidents, verified packages

## Open Questions

- **Interop with Anthropic:** Will Anthropic support/endorse this approach? Should we contribute back to their skill system?
- **Standard Leadership:** Should we help lead A2A protocol adoption, or propose a new open standard for skills?
- **Framework Support Timeline:** Which frameworks should we support in Phase 2 (OpenAI, Google, others)?
- **Governance:** Community governance model? Code of conduct? Verified publishers?
- **Monetization:** Should premium skills be supported? Revenue sharing model?
- **Security:** How strict should verification be? Risk vs usability tradeoff?
- **Discoverability:** How do we ensure skills are findable without AI-generated spam?
