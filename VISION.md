# Skills Package Manager - Vision Document

## Problem Statement

Currently, Roundtable skills are:
- **Static** - Bundled at build time into applications
- **Monolithic** - All skills deployed together
- **Hard to Share** - No standard distribution mechanism
- **Redundant** - Similar skills duplicated across projects
- **Heavyweight** - Applications bloated with unused skills

## Solution

A package manager system that treats skills as first-class distributable components:
- **Discoverable** - Search and find skills by capability
- **Downloadable** - Install on-demand, not at build time
- **Versioned** - Multiple versions coexist
- **Community-Driven** - Anyone can publish skills
- **Secure** - Registry can be public or private

## Core Concepts

### Skill Package
```yaml
name: data-analysis-expert
version: 1.0.0
description: Expert system for data analysis and visualization
tags: [data-science, analytics, visualization]
author: roundtable-community
license: MIT
dependencies:
  - roundtable: ">=2.0.0"
registry: https://skills.roundtable.dev
```

### Registry
Centralized service that hosts skill metadata and packages:
- **Public Registry** - Community skills (like npm/PyPI)
- **Private Registries** - Enterprise/organization skills
- **Search API** - Discover skills by tags, keywords, capability

### Installation
```bash
roundtable skills install data-analysis-expert
roundtable skills install @org/internal-skill
roundtable skills search "machine learning"
```

### Runtime Integration
Applications discover and load skills:
```typescript
const skillManager = new SkillManager({
  registryUrl: 'https://skills.roundtable.dev',
  cacheDir: '.roundtable/skills'
});

const dataSkills = await skillManager.search('data-science');
const analysisExpert = await skillManager.install('data-analysis-expert@latest');
```

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Skill Package Format
- Standard skill packaging (zip/tar)
- Metadata file (YAML/JSON)
- Version management
- Dependency specification

### 2. Registry Service
- REST API for search/discovery
- Package storage and versioning
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas

### 3. Client/Manager
- CLI commands for package management
- Runtime loader and cache
- Version resolution
- Security validation

### 4. Security Layer
- Package signing
- Registry authentication
- Sandbox/isolation for untrusted skills
- Audit logging

## Phases (Proposed)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Skill packaging format
- Basic registry (file-based or simple API)
- CLI commands (install, search, list)
- Local cache management

### Phase 2: Distribution
- Production registry service
- Public skill marketplace
- Community publishing workflow
- Versioning and dependency resolution

### Phase 3: Enterprise
- Private registries
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Audit trails
- Enterprise skill bundles

### Phase 4: Advanced
- Skill composition and bundling
- Performance optimization and CDN
- Skill marketplace and ratings
- Advanced discovery (ML-based recommendations)

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** Number of published community skills
- **Reuse:** Skills used across multiple applications
- **Performance:** Time to discover and install skills
- **Community:** Active contributors and maintainers
- **Security:** Zero security incidents, verified packages

## Open Questions

- Should we fork/adapt existing package managers (npm, poetry) or build custom?
- Public vs private registry strategy?
- How to handle skill dependencies and version conflicts?
- Security model for untrusted skills?
- Monetization strategy (if any)?
- Community governance model?
